# Democratizing Large Model Training

[**Forgather**](https://github.com/jdinalt/forgather) is an alpha-stage ML framework that aims to make large model training accessible to hobbyists and researchers with consumer hardware.

## The Vision

### 🚀 **Pipeline Parallelism for Consumer GPUs**
Enable training of models larger than single GPU memory by distributing them across multiple consumer-grade cards using [Torch Distributed Pipeline Parallelism](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/main/distributed.pipelining.html) Our goal is to make 7B+ parameter full model training accessible without enterprise hardware.

### 📝 **End Configuration Duplication**
Eliminate the copy-paste cycle of ML experiments through a powerful template inheritance system. Specify only what changes between experiments, not entire configurations.

### 🔧 **Framework-Independent Models**
Generate standalone Python code that works without dependencies on Forgather itself. Your trained models remain portable and deployable anywhere.

## Current Status: Alpha

Forgather is in active development with core functionality implemented:

- ✅ Template inheritance system working
- ✅ Pipeline parallelism implemented  
- ✅ Code generation pipeline functional
- ✅ Multi-GPU distributed training
- 🔄 Performance optimization ongoing
- 🔄 Documentation and examples expanding

## Seeking Collaborators

We're looking for contributors who share our vision of democratizing AI:

### 🧪 **Researchers & Experimenters**
Help test pipeline parallelism with different model architectures and share your findings.

### 💻 **ML Engineers**  
Contribute to performance optimization, memory efficiency, and distributed training improvements.

### 📚 **Documentation & Examples**
Help create tutorials, guides, and example configurations for the community.

### 🔧 **Core Development**
Contribute to framework architecture, code generation, and template systems.

## What We're Building

- **Accessible Training**: 7B+ models on consumer setups
- **Template-Driven**: Systematic experimentation without configuration chaos
- **Pipeline Parallelism**: Much faster than FSDP on hardware lacking a fast interconnect
- **Framework Freedom**: Generated models work independently
- **Research Focus**: Built for exploration and comparison

## Early Results

Initial testing on 4x RTX 4090 setup shows promising results for 7B parameter model training with various pipeline schedules. We're particularly excited about zero-bubble pipeline performance, though optimization work continues.
